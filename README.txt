This is a multi tabbed image viewer.

It is written in IronPython as an example application that uses IronPython and
Windows Forms.

The main file is 'main.py'.

You need to run it with 'ipy.exe' or 'ipyw.exe' from the IronPython
distribution.

If you have a batch file setup on your PATH called 'ip', which runs
IronPython, then you can use 'run.bat'.
